## Notes
### 1. The building blocks 
- The processes ("patterns")[^2] of healing after ending a relationship[^1] or any ending crisis are similar for everyone.

 
## Anki Card

## Highlights
[^1]:  You may have initiated the breakup, or you may have received a terse text message. Your ex-partner may have been a wonderful person, or a jerk. Whatever your own story, right now, it hurts like hell. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CFGRH52&location=137))
[^2]: These patterns are similar not only for the ending of a love relationship, but for any ending crisis that comes along in your life. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CFGRH52&location=271))
