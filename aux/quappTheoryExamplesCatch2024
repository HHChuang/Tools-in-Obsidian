## Summary 
>[!summary]
>Catch bond is a collection of bonds which have a longer lifetime with external forces. Using the Newton trajectory, the potential change topography such that the external forces increase the barrier height[^1].

>May be related to [[maedaArtificialForceInduced2016|Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) Method for Exploring Quantum Chemical Potential Energy Surfaces]]?

[^1]: An indicator for a catch bond can be a large movement of the involved stationary states of the PES under external force. [(p.4099)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XAVHD6YZ?page=4099&annotation=8TWHFRMM)

The solution of this EoM and gradient is called Newton trajectory [(p. 4098)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XAVHD6YZ?page=4098&annotation=7S5FZU27)
- More generally, an NT  connects stationary points of an index difference of one.15−17 A solution curve has to cross a point on its path where it holds Det(H) = 0. The force in the direction f with the magnitude to reach the point with Det(H) = 0 forces the former minimum and former saddle SP1 to coincide. This event is called the bond  breaking point (BBP).7 [(p. 4098)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XAVHD6YZ?page=4098&annotation=5K7GHG8H)
- Each local point on the Det(H) = 0 manifold determines one solution curve of eq 3, though its corresponding gradient direction is there. [(p. 4098)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XAVHD6YZ?page=4098&annotation=4E9TTML2)
- The reason is that along every solution curve of eq 3, the gradient direction is fixed and is equal to f. The manifold Det(H) = 0 crosses anywhere on  the PES, the manifold of valley-ridge inflection (VRI)  points.16,18−21 [(p. 4098)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XAVHD6YZ?page=4098&annotation=S3TQZPHA)

## Slip and catch bonds 

>[!multi-column]
>>**slip bonds**
>>Slip Bonds. There are different types of bonds: one type  is the ideal bond40,41 being insensitive against tensile forces. It has been suggested to play a role in enabling the receptor−ligand pair to withstand tensile force, but it has not yet been reported in experiments. [(p. 4098)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XAVHD6YZ?page=4098&annotation=VAG7T3IC)
>
>> **catch bonds**
>> Increase the external force, the lifetime increase (counterintuitive to normal chemical bond)
>> **Force-Enhanced Stability:** The bond becomes more stable as force increases, up to an optimal level.
>> • **Biological Relevance:** Observed in various biological systems, such as **selectins** involved in white blood cell adhesion and **dynein** motor proteins interacting with microtubules.
>> • **Transition to Slip Bond:** At forces beyond a certain threshold, catch bonds transition to slip bond behaviour, where the lifetime decreases with further force.
>> 
>>**Theoretical Explanation **
>> The document discusses catch bonds in the context of **molecular potential energy surfaces (PESs)** and explains them using **Newton trajectories (NTs)**. NTs help describe how molecules behave under external forces:
>> • Catch bonds arise when the direction of applied force causes the **energy barrier for dissociation** to **increase**, thereby stabilising the bond.
>> • They are contrasted with slip bonds, where the energy barrier decreases under force, leading to quicker dissociation.
